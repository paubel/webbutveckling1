The error you're encountering suggests that the GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) you're using doesn't have the necessary permissions to push to the repository `paubel/webbutveckling1.git`. Here are a few steps to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:

1. Check your PAT permissions:
   Make sure the PAT you're using has the necessary permissions to push to the repository. It should have at least `repo` scope for private repositories or `public_repo` for public repositories.

2. Verify the PAT:
   Double-check that the PAT is correctly stored in your repository secrets and that you're referencing it correctly in your workflow file.

3. Repository permissions:
   Ensure that the GitHub account associated with the PAT has write access to the `paubel/webbutveckling1` repository.

4. Branch name:
   Your workflow is set up to push to the `master` branch, but your workflow triggers on pushes to `main`. Make sure you're using the correct branch names consistently.

Here's an updated version of your workflow that addresses some of these issues:

```yaml
name: Sync Repos
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  sync:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout source repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Push to destination repository
        run: |
          git config --global user.email "paul.belfrage@skola.malmo.se"
          git config --global user.name "paul-pauliskolan"
          git clone https://${{ secrets.PAT }}@github.com/paubel/webbutveckling1.git
          cd webbutveckling1
          git remote add source-repo https://${{ secrets.PAT }}@github.com/paul-pauliskolan/webbutveckling1.git
          git fetch source-repo
          git merge source-repo/main --allow-unrelated-histories
          git push origin main
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PAT }}
```

Key changes:
- Added `fetch-depth: 0` to the checkout action to fetch all history.
- Changed `master` to `main` in the git commands to match your trigger branch.
- Used `git fetch` instead of `git remote update` for clarity.

If you're still encountering issues after these changes, you may want to:
1. Regenerate your PAT and update it in your repository secrets.
2. Double-check that the account associated with the PAT has the necessary permissions on both repositories.
3. Verify that the repository names and URLs are correct.
